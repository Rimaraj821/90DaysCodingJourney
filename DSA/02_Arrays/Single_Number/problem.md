# Single Number

## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty integer array `nums`, every element appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

Find and return that single element.

You must implement a solution with:
- Linear runtime complexity.
- Constant extra space.

 Example 1

Input:
nums = [2,2,1]

Output:
1

 Example 2

Input:
nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output:
4

---

 Example 3

Input:
nums = [1]

Output:
1

 Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
- Each element appears twice except for one element which appears once.
