Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, rotate the array to the right by k steps.

The rotation must be performed in-place, without using any extra array.

Examples
Example 1

Input:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
k = 3


Output:

[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Example 2

Input:

nums = [-1,-100,3,99]
k = 2


Output:

[3,99,-1,-100]

Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5

-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

0 <= k <= 10^5



The array must be modified in-place.

Extra space is not allowed.
