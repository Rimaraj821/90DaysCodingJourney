This repository represents a personal commitment to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through 90 days of disciplined, focused, and consistent problem solving.

This is not a random collection of solutions.
It is a structured journey of effort, reflection, and continuous improvement.

Purpose

  I started this challenge with one clear goal:
  
  To build strong problem-solving fundamentals
  
  To think in terms of patterns, not memorized answers
  
  To write clean, optimized, and scalable code
  
  To prepare myself for high-level technical interviews

Every single problem solved here reflects deliberate practice — not just completion, but understanding.

 What This Repository Contains

Each day includes:

  Problem Statement
  
  Approach & Thought Process
  
  Optimized Solution
  
  Time & Space Complexity Analysis
  
  Key Learnings

I focus on clarity, efficiency, and improvement over perfection.

Core Areas Covered

Arrays & Strings

Recursion & Backtracking

Linked Lists

Stack & Queue

Trees & Binary Trees

Graphs

Dynamic Programming

Greedy Algorithms

Consistency is non-negotiable.

 What This Challenge Represents

  This challenge represents:
  Commitment over comfort
  Consistency over motivation
  Growth over excuses

I believed strong fundamentals create strong engineers.
This repository is proof of my dedication to becoming one.


This repository reflects my work ethic, structured learning approach, and determination to improve every single day.

I am actively building my problem-solving ability — one day at a time.
